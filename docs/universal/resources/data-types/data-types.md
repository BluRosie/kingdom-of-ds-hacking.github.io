# Data Types

## Introduction
In computing, a data type is an attributed piece of data. The attribute tells the computer how to interpret the data associated with it, allowing it to perform a certain set of operations (and explicitly those operations). 

This reference guide aims to provide you information on the various data types used on the Nintendo DS.

## Bit
A bit is a binary (base-2) value which is the underpinning of all data types. It is analogous to a light switch, where turning on and off the light are two distinct options. 

A single bit can represent two distinct values, `0`, or `1`. Bits can be combined into a `binary string` of any length, which allows you to represent any number as a series of `0` and `1`s.

## Byte
A `byte` is a data type that is comprised of 8 bits in a sequential order.
